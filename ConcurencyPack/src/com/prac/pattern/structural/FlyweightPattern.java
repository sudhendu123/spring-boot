 *Flyweight is used when there is a need to create high number of objects of almost similar nature.
 * High number of objects consumes high memory and flyweight design pattern gives a solution to reduce
 *  the load on memory by sharing objects. It is achieved by segregating object properties into
 *   two types intrinsic and extrinsic.
 *   
 *    All the wrapper classes valueOf() method uses cached objects showing use of Flyweight design pattern. 
 *    The best example is Java String class String Pool implementation.
